MapIt is a service that maps geographical points to administrative areas.
This edition is based on source data from the totally amazing
<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> project,
so add your boundaries there if they&rsquo;re missing.
If you&rsquo;re in the UK our <a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/">MapIt UK</a>
with open Ordnance Survey data will probably be more useful.
</p>
<p>
MapIt is useful for anyone who has the co-ordinates of a point on Earth, and
who needs to find out what country, region, city, constituency, or state it
lies within. It&rsquo;s also great for looking up the shapes of all those
boundaries.

<p>Charitable, low volume use of this service is free &ndash;
