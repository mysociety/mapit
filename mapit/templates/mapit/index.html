MapIt is a service that maps UK postcodes and geographical points to
administrative areas. It&rsquo;s useful for anyone who has a postcode or
co-ordinates of a point in the UK, and needs to find out what region,
constituency, or council it lies within. It&rsquo;s also great for looking up
the shapes of all those boundaries.

                <p>Whenever an area is returned from MapIt, it is as a

                generation 14 contains the pre-2011 Scottish Parliament
                constituencies. Only current Northern Ireland constituencies
                are present; if you need pre-2010 UK Parliament NI
                constituencies, or pre-2011 Northern Ireland Assembly
                constituencies, you can work it out from the wards and the 2003
                SNAC file in the data/ directory.

            <h3>About MapIt</h3>

            <p>MapIt was written back in 2003 as a postcode lookup to power the
            original <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a> sites
            such as <a href="http://www.writetothem.com/">WriteToThem</a>. Over
            time it gained features such as point lookup (for
            <a href="http://www.fixmystreet.com/">FixMyStreet</a>), and when
            Ordnance Survey data became freely available in 2010, it was
            rewritten and made public for the whole UK.

            {% if country == 'GB' %}
                        
            Versions have appeared in other countries, such as
            <a href="http://mapit.nuug.no/">Norway</a>, and in 2012 we released a
            <a href="">global version</a> based on OpenStreetMap data.
