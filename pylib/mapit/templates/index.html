<p id="donate">mySociety is run by a registered charity &ndash; please
<a href="http://www.mysociety.org/donate/">donate</a> to help keep us going and
to be able to continue to do things like this!</p>

<p>MaPit is our database and web service that maps
<strong>postcodes</strong> and <strong>points</strong> to current or past
administrative area information and polygons for <strong>all</strong> the
United Kingdom. It has been rewritten from the
ground up in GeoDjango and PostGIS, providing us with a large array of
improvements including speed, a lovely admin interface, and much easier
updating. The source code is
<a href="http://github.com/mysociety/mapit">available on GitHub</a>.

<form method="post" action="/postcode/">
    <label for="pc">Postcode:</label>
    <input type="text" name="pc" id="pc" size="8">

</form>

<p>Another notable benefit is that this new version has been filled with only
totally open data, so you can be secure that you can reuse the data from this
site under the minimal terms of the licences given below. It is based on
<a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/opendata/">OS OpenData</a>
Boundary-Line and Code-Point for Great Britain, and
<a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/about-statistics/geography/products/geog-products-postcode/nspd/">NSPD Open</a>
for Northern Ireland, with Super Output Areas from ONS. You can download raw copies of these datasets from
our <a href="http://parlvid.mysociety.org:81/os/">data mirror</a>, which
you can then use in your own copy of this service.

<h2>API</h2>

<p>Non-commercial, low-volume use of this service is free. You will need to attribute
OS/RM/ONS as per their licenses, and please do attribute us too :) For commercial or
high-volume usage, please <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/contact/">contact us</a>
about using the service, by licensing or by helping you install your own version.</p>

<p>All calls below are made to http://{{ request.META.HTTP_HOST }}/ and return JSON
(on some calls, stick .html on the end for an HTML version). By default, calls
will return active areas; for some calls you may specify a previous generation
to look up instead. The main difference in generation 12 is that it contains
the pre-2010 England and Wales Parliamentary constituencies; generation 14
contains the pre-2011 Scottish Parliament constituencies. Only current Northern
Ireland constituencies are present; if you need pre-2010 UK Parliament NI
constituencies, or pre-2011 Northern Ireland Assembly constituencies, you can
work it out from the wards and the 2003 SNAC file in the data/ directory.

Whenever an area is returned from MaPit, it is as a dictionary with the
following keys: id, name, country, type, parent_area, generation_low,
generation_high, codes.</p>

ones you probably are interested in are 27700 for British National Grid, 4326
for WGS84 lon/lat, and 29902 for the Irish National Grid. You can restrict
results to particular area types with a type parameter (multiple types
separated by commas), and have results for a previous generation with a
