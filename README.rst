MapIt
=====

MapIt is an open source project to help people run a web service that maps
geographical points to administrative areas. It is useful for anyone who has
the co-ordinates of a point on Earth, and who needs to find out what country,
region, city, constituency, or state it lies within. Itâ€™s also great for
looking up the shapes of all those boundaries.

It was created in 2003 by `mySociety <http://www.mysociety.org/>`_, a UK
charity, for use by their various tools needing admin area lookup.

Installation
------------

MapIt can be installed as a Django app, or as a standalone server. For full
details, please see our site at http://code.mapit.mysociety.org/ for help
and documentation.

Examples
--------

`mySociety <http://www.mysociety.org>`_ runs public installations of MapIt that
you might be able to use:

    * `MapIt Global <http://global.mapit.mysociety.org/>`_ - global boundaries
      from the `OpenStreetMap <http://www.openstreetmap.org/>`_ project.
    * `MapIt UK <http://mapit.mysociety.org/>`_ - UK boundaries from various
      sources.

The above are free for non-commercial, low-volume use. For details of
what constitutes "low-volume", and for commercial licensing arrangements,
please consult `MapIt Usage and Licensing 
<http://mapit.mysociety.org/licensing>` . 


Rate limiting
-------------

Usage is rate limited by default; clients may be rate limited by IP address
or by a User Token passed in the User-Agent: header. Clients may be excluded 
from the effects of rate limiting via the RATE_LIMIT option in the 
configuration file.
