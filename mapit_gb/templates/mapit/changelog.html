<h3>2014-12-05 - October 2014 Boundary-Line import</h3>

<em>Generation 23</em>, containing the import of the October 2014
Boundary-Line. This edition reverted all the Torfaen changes from May 2014, not
just articles 5, 6 and 10, and so we have revoked those additional changes too,
returning the Torfaen communities and electoral districts to as they were in
the October 2013 edition.

<h3>2014-10-14 - Torfaen council changes</h3>

<p>A one-off script was run to fix up some of the changes to Torfaen
wards/communities in the May 2014 edition of Boundary-Line that should not
have been present.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/wsi/2013/2156/contents/made">
http://www.legislation.gov.uk/wsi/2013/2156/contents/made</a> is the source
for all of this. Specifically, section 2 saying that articles 5, 6 and 10
don't come into operation until before the next election, which is 2017.</p>

<p>This script revoked the changes made for the purposes of articles 5 and 6,
but the changes for article 10 overlap with changes for (active) articles 8
and 9, so we will live with those being incorrect until Ordnance Survey
release hopefully fixed boundaries in October.</p>

<p>Boundaries W05000993, W04000981, W05000997, W04000984, W05000995, and
W05000996 were deleted, with W05000771, W04000761, W05000779, W04000767,
W05000777, and W05000777 reinstated.</p>
