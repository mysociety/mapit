    # There is a problem, in that users of this service, including ourselves,
    # have assumed a mapit ID is an identifier for a concept, rather than a
    # particular boundary. Until now, this has not really been an issue, but
    # this edition of Boundary-Line changes the boundary of four councils,
    # assigning them new ONS IDs in the process. This would cause some amount
    # of pain for code that assumes e.g. ID 2579 is the concept of Glasgow City
    # Council, rather than the boundary of Glasgow City Council from
    # generations 1 to 16 (but then not 17).
    #
    # Therefore, for the time being, we have decided to match up the new
    # boundaries with the current mapit IDs for these four councils. The old
    # boundaries will be lost from mapit, but could be loaded in manually from
    # the last edition of Boundary-Line if we really wanted, assigned new IDs.
    #
    # In the future, perhaps the current IDs should host the concept, for
    # continuity, and the current and historical boundaries are then available
    # under it in some way. Tricky.
    #
    # NB: After import_boundary_line is run with this control file, the GSS
    # codes of these four councils will need updating to their new entries, as
    # it will have maintained the old codes.
